# **App Name**: RoleCraft AI

## Core Features:

- Role Selection: User selects an AI role: Marketer, Programmer, Writer, or Public Speaker.
- Role-Specific Content Generation: AI generates outputs tailored to the selected role. It may employ a tool for reasoning to determine whether particular marketing concepts are relevant.
- Multi-Modal Output Display: Display the AI-generated content in a clear, role-appropriate format (e.g., code snippets with syntax highlighting for Programmer, speech outline for Public Speaker).
- Iterative Refinement: Users can provide feedback to refine the AI's output through natural language prompts.
- Conversation History: The application stores user's prior requests and the AI's generated responses.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, eye-catching blue (#4285F4) to represent intelligence, reliability, and innovation.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E8F0FE) to provide a clean and professional backdrop.
- Accent color: An analogous green (#34A853), to create good contrast while still harmonizing.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. For a computer science context, the two fonts blend in a contemporary feel while retaining functional readability.
- Use clean, modern icons representing each role (e.g., a megaphone for the public speaker role).
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, with a clear distinction between input fields, role selection, and output display.
- Subtle animations and transitions to indicate processing and feedback.
